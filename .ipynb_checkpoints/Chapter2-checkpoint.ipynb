    "The explaination of Lagrange multipliers is good enough to use the technique to solve problems, but does not really explain why it works. I would have included some \"derivation\" by following Serge Lang's book on calculus. That is, consider a curve on the constraint surface that passes through the max/min point of f on that surface. Taking the derivative we see that $\\nabla f(\\gamma(t)) \\cdot \\gamma'(t) = 0$ for all curves $\\gamma$ that satisfy the above. The Lagrange condition follows immediately. "
